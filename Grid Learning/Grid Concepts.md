# Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces.

It consist of columns and rows.

# Grid Container

The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.

# Grid Item

The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

# Grid Line

The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

# Grid Cell

The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single “unit” of the grid.

# Grid Track

The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as the columns or rows of the grid.

# Grid Area

The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells.
